 Steganography is a practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image, or video.
 
 APPLICATIONS:
    Military   
    Intelligence agencies
    On line elections
    Internet banking
    Medical-imaging and so on.

Though there are different possible methods available, we would go with digital steganography
In digital method the message is concealed within the lowest bits of images or sound files.
The current project expects us to implement LSB (Least Significant Bit) Image Steganography on a .bmp file.
